## Hands-on Reinforcement learning
***
The repo provides you with solution for multiple OpenAI environments using classical reinforcement learning methods. 
So far, the Taxi-v3 and the MountainCar-v0 solutions are added.

|Environmet| Algorithm | Model-based | Link|
|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---:|
|Taxi-v3   | SARSA      |  No | [link](https://github.com/alirezahss88/Reinforcement-Learning-/blob/master/Taxi%20v3%20with%20SARSA%20algorithm.ipynb) |
|MountainCar-v0| Q-learning|No| [link](https://github.com/alirezahss88/Reinforcement-Learning-/blob/master/MountainCar-v0%20with%20Q-learning.ipynb) |




**Pre-requisits:**

You need to have a concrete knowledge of Reinforcement Learning and the Python programming language specifically OOP.

Also, You need to have installed the following packages before starting running the code.

- OpenAI gym
```
pip install gym
```
- Numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
- Pyglet
```
pip install pyglet
