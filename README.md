**Hands-on Reinforcement learning**
***
The repo provides solution for multiple OpenAI environments using classical reinforcement learning methods. 
So far, the Taxi-v3 is added and solved using SARSA method and the MountainCar-v0 using discretized Q-learning algorithm.

**Pre-requisits:**

You need to have a concrete knowledge of Reinforcement Learning and the Python programming language especifically OOP.
You need to have installed the following packages before starting running the code.
