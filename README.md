## Hands-on Reinforcement learning
***
The repo provides solution for multiple OpenAI environments using classical reinforcement learning methods. 
So far, the Taxi-v3 and the MountainCar-v0 solutions are added.

Environmet| Algorithm | Model-based | 
----------|-----------|-------------|---
Taxi-v3   | SARSA      |  False
